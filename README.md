# D3-Stacked Barchart and Data Table

This is a webpage designed to show users how much interest they will pay over the course of a loan, and how much of each monthly payment will be devoted to paying off the interest.

Users can input how much the initial loan was, the monthly payment, and the annual interest rate. Data is calculated in javascript and the visualizations are built using the d3 library (v4).
